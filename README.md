### Raflash: Combining Raffles with Flash Loans for Maximized Rewards.

Raflash is an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) project that merges the excitement of raffles with the financial mechanics of flash loans.
Participants buy tickets to enter the raffle, and the funds collected from ticket sales are utilized for flash loans.
The fees earned from these flash loans are then accumulated and awarded to the lucky winner of a future draw.
One of the unique aspects of Raflash is that users can get their money back, making it a win-win situation.
Even if participants don't win the raffle, part of the earnings will go to charity, ensuring that everyone benefits.
By integrating the unique benefits of flash loans with the fun and anticipation of raffles, Raflash offers a novel way for users to engage in DeFi while potentially earning significant rewards and contributing to a good cause.
Join Raflash to experience a new level of participation and excitement in the crypto world, where everyone is happy.

SECRET BEHIND FLASH LOAN:

Because this struct **does not have the key or store ability**, **it cannot be transferred or otherwise placed in persistent storage**.
Because it **does not have the drop ability**, **it cannot be discarded**.
Thus, the **only way to get rid of this struct is to call repay** sometime during the transaction that created it, which is exactly what we want from a flash loan.
